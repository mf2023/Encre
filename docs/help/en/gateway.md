## WeChat example (QR login)

The WeChat adapter supports **QR code login**:

1. Choose the QR login option in the WeChat adapter
2. Click **Connect**; a **QR code** is shown (with a countdown)
3. Scan it with WeChat and authorize
4. Once connected, chat with the agent through that WeChat account
5. **Unlink** anytime if needed

> [!NOTE]
> The QR code has an expiry time. If it shows "QR code expired", hit refresh and scan again.

## Common settings

Some channels offer more options:

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Target model | The model used for that channel's chats; leave empty for no limit |

## What gateway is for

- **Chat**: talk with the agent inside chat platforms
- **Receive automation results**: scheduled tasks push outcomes to the gateway
- **Notifications**: alerts when tasks finish or hit problems

See [Automation](/en/automation) for the full push workflow.

> [!TIP]
> If a test connection fails, check that the Token/Secret was copied completely, the account has the required permissions, and outgoing network access works.
