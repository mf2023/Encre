At the top of the Encre Agent window there is a three-way mode switcher. You can switch at any time without quitting or restarting.

| Mode | Use case | Extra sidebar features |
| --- | --- | --- |
| General | Everyday chat, analysis, Q&A | Basic sessions |
| Work (iWork) | Working on a project folder | Workspaces, indexing, code assist |
| Automation | Scheduled tasks | Automation job management |

## General mode

The default mode. Best for everyday questions, brainstorming, and research that does not depend on a specific folder.

- Attach files directly with @ so the agent can read them
- The sidebar lists all your sessions under "All tasks"
- Great for any conversation without a specific project context

## Work (iWork) mode

The agent can genuinely "understand" your project only after you open a folder in a workspace:

- **Workspace**: register a local folder as a workspace; the agent reads/writes files and runs commands inside it
- **Indexing**: the first time you open a workspace, a code/file index is built automatically; answers can then reference specific files and line numbers
- To open a folder: Sidebar → Workspace → Open Folder, or use the shortcut (see [Shortcuts](/en/shortcuts))

See [Workspace](/en/workspace) for details.

## Automation mode

Hand repetitive work to scheduled tasks:

- Create scheduled jobs from templates or custom definitions (daily reports, weekly reports, sentiment monitoring, stock alerts, and so on)
- Configure the schedule and the executing model
- Results can be pushed to gateway platforms (Telegram, email, etc.)

> [!NOTE]
> All three modes share the same app and account; switching just changes how you work right now and never deletes your history.
