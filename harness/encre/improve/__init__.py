"""Self-improvement subsystem.

Consolidated from the former top-level ``eval`` / ``learning`` /
``evolution`` / ``feedback`` packages (Task 7.4 of the architecture
refactor).  Everything that measures, learns, or adapts agent behaviour
over time lives here:
- ``encre.improve.eval``      鈥?benchmark runner and task suite
- ``encre.improve.learning``  鈥?experience consolidation and skill generation
- ``encre.improve.evolution`` 鈥?reflex/optimizer loop and event store
- ``encre.improve.feedback``  鈥?user feedback learner
