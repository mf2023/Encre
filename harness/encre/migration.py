"""Full data-dir export/import for migrating an Encre install between machines.

The whole ``~/.dunimd/encre`` data directory is bundled into a *plaintext* zip
(with the exception of ``logs``, ``yimd.log`` and ``yimd.pid``).  Every file
that was AES-256-GCM encrypted with the *source* machine's key is decrypted
first so the resulting archive contains only readable plaintext.  A
``manifest.json`` inside the archive records which files were encrypted and in
which wire format (``text`` = base64 string, ``raw`` = ``nonce||ct||tag``
bytes), so :func:`import_all` can re-encrypt exactly the same set with the
*target* machine's freshly-generated key (see ``encre.crypto.ensure_keyfile``).

Because AES-GCM verification uses a 16-byte authentication tag, a successful
decrypt is cryptographically conclusive: the file was encrypted by this
machine's key.  A failed decrypt therefore means the file was plaintext on disk
and it is copied verbatim.
