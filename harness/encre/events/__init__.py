"""Typed event infrastructure for the Encre agent.

Exports:

* :class:`EventStream` -- typed publish/subscribe fan-out stream with
  async iteration (the single contract between the loop and every event
  consumer: frontend transport, plugin taps, telemetry).
* :class:`PhaseBus` -- named-phase lifecycle hooks; carries the historical
  ``pre_model_request`` semantics.
* ``PHASE_*`` constants -- well-known phase names.
* Session-lifecycle events (:mod:`~encre.events.lifecycle`) -- typed
  ``SessionEvent`` dataclasses published alongside the agent events.
