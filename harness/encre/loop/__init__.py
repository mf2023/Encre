"""Encre agent loop package.

The former monolithic ``encre/loop.py`` is split into:

* :mod:`encre.loop.runner` -- the ``EncreLoop`` coordinator and phase sequence;
* :mod:`encre.loop.wiring` -- constructor wiring of every collaborator;
* :mod:`encre.loop.control` -- external control API (plan mode, permissions,
  commands);
* :mod:`encre.loop.support` -- cross-phase helper methods;
* :mod:`encre.loop.turn_ctx` -- the shared :class:`TurnContext` /
  :class:`TurnExit` control contract;
* :mod:`encre.loop.phases` -- the per-turn phase mixins (prompt, compact,
  model, recovery, tools, execute).
