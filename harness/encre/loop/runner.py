"""The agent loop runner: assembles the loop from mixins and orchestrates phases.

``EncreLoop`` is the heart of the Encre backend: it drives a single
conversational agent turn-by-turn, streaming model output and tool calls to the
frontend while managing an extensive set of cross-cutting concerns. In
addition to calling the model backend it orchestrates:

* **Tool execution** -- discovery, permission gating, safety checks, streaming
  pre-execution, and bounded concurrency.
* **Recovery** -- a unified :class:`~encre.loop_error.ErrorOrchestrator` that
  classifies backend/tool errors and decides retry, fallback, compact, or
  graceful-stop actions.
* **Compaction** -- reactive and background context compaction to stay under
  token budgets, with a frontend refresh flag.
* **Plan mode** -- a "plan-first" workflow where write-class tools are
  previewed and require explicit user approval.
* **Skills & sub-agents** -- dynamic skill activation and delegation to
  specialised sub-agent roles (researcher / executor / critic).
* **Stability** -- token-budget "grace" calls, steer injections, and stuck-loop
  detection.
* **Persistence & observability** -- session metadata, OpenTelemetry tracing,
  and milestone summaries.

The loop is intentionally a thin coordinator; fine-grained behaviour lives in
the phase mixins (``encre.loop.phases.*``), the collaborator wiring
(``encre.loop.wiring``), the control surface (``encre.loop.control``), the
cross-phase helpers (``encre.loop.support``) and the manager objects those
modules construct (``StateManager``, ``CommandManager``, ``PlanModeManager``,
``SkillManager``, ``WorkingSetManager``, ``SubAgentRunner`` and the
``loop_stability`` helpers).  This module keeps only the run orchestration:
the per-turn phase sequence, the control-flow translation (``do_continue`` /
``do_break`` / :class:`~encre.loop.turn_ctx.TurnExit`) and the post-loop
finalisation.

    """Turn-by-turn conversational agent loop with full recovery and tooling.

    ``EncreLoop`` owns a session and a configured backend and runs the agent:
    it builds the prompt context, streams model output and tool calls, executes
    tools with safety/permission gating, and applies recovery/compaction
    strategies when things go wrong. It also exposes the plan-mode, skill, and
    sub-agent surfaces that the desktop UI drives through method calls.

    Rather than implementing every concern inline, the loop composes a set of
    manager objects (state, commands, plan mode, skills, working set, sub-agent
    runner) and a unified error orchestrator. Many public attributes are thin
    properties that forward to those managers so legacy call sites keep working.

    Attributes
    ----------
    config, session:
        The immutable-ish configuration and the persistent session this loop
        drives.
    backend:
        The lazily created model backend (``None`` only before construction in
        ``__init__`` completes).
    _child_loops:
        Set of sub-loop references spawned by this loop, cancelled together when
        the user stops the parent.
    _state:
        Per-run :class:`~encre.loop_state.state.LoopState`, rebuilt each run.
    _error_orch:
        The :class:`~encre.loop_error.ErrorOrchestrator` owning all recovery
        decisions and counters.
