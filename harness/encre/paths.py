"""Single source of truth for the Encre on-disk data root.

This module is deliberately dependency-free: it sits **below** both
:mod:`encre.config` and :mod:`encre.config_store`, which would otherwise
form an import cycle (the store needs the data root, the config model
needs the store).

Why it exists: the data tree used to be resolved by two independent
implementations -- :func:`encre.config.get_data_dir` and a second, ad-hoc
``_get_yim_data_dir`` in ``core/encre/protocol/handlers/workspace_store``.
The two had drifted apart (the latter skipped ``expanduser``, never
created the directory, and duplicated the environment-variable lookup
with subtly different semantics).  Every path under the data tree must
now be built from here.
