"""Process capability seam.

Single implementation for every subprocess power in Encre:
- spawning with window suppression (:mod:`encre.capabilities.process.spawn`)
- background shells (:class:`BackgroundShellManager`)
- persistent terminals (:class:`TerminalSessionManager`)
- path sandboxing (:mod:`encre.capabilities.process.sandbox`)

The Rust ``permission_check`` call path is unaffected: permission
decisions happen in the tools layer before reaching this seam.
