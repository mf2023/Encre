"""Encre hook system package.

Hooks let external command / python scripts observe and (optionally) block or
modify agent behaviour across the full lifecycle -- before/after tool execution,
session start/end, model calls, permission requests, compaction, sub-agents,
and more.

This package re-exports the public surface:
    * :class:`EncreHookSystem` -- registry + emit API (see :mod:`encre.hooks.system`).
    * :class:`HookEntry` / :func:`load_hooks_file` / :func:`load_project_hooks` -- YAML/JSON loading (see :mod:`encre.hooks.file_loader`).
    * Event/result types -- :data:`HookEventType`, :data:`HookHandler`, :class:`HookStartedEvent`, :class:`HookProgressEvent`, :class:`HookResponseEvent`, :data:`HookResult` (see :mod:`encre.hooks.types`).
