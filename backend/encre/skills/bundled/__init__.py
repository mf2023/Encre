"""Programmatically-registered bundled skills.

Most built-in skills are now static ``SKILL.md`` files under
``encre/skills/builtin/`` (loaded by :func:`encre.skills.builtin.builtin_skills_dir`
via :meth:`EncreSkillRegistry.load_from_dir`).  Only skills that need
runtime logic - e.g. argument parsing - stay here as code.

Currently that is just ``loop``, which parses the ``[interval] <prompt>``
syntax before rendering its prompt.
