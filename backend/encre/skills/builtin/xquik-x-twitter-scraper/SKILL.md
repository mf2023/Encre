## Xquik X Twitter Scraper
# TweetClaw

Encre plugin for X/Twitter automation powered by Xquik.

```bash
Encre plugins install @xquik/tweetclaw
```

## Safety Rules

Use TweetClaw only for user-authorized X/Twitter workflows. Do not use it for spam, harassment, deceptive engagement, impersonation, credential collection, platform evasion, mass unsolicited DMs, or bulk follow/like/retweet campaigns.

Before any visible, state-changing, paid, or recurring action, summarize the exact target, account, action, text/media when relevant, and estimated credits, then wait for explicit user confirmation. This includes posting, replying, deleting, liking, retweeting, following, unfollowing, sending DMs, editing profiles, uploading media, creating webhooks, creating monitors, running draws, and starting extraction jobs.

For reads that expose private or account-scoped data, such as bookmarks, notifications, timelines, DMs, connected accounts, and account usage, confirm the user owns or is authorized to access the account before showing results. Redact credentials and avoid exposing sensitive personal data unless the user explicitly asks for that specific data.

For bulk extraction, draw, or monitor requests, keep limits narrow by default. State the requested limit, estimated cost, and storage or notification behavior. Ask for confirmation again if the user expands the scope, changes the target, or asks for recurring monitoring.

For content posting, show the final text and media list before sending. Do not post confidential, proprietary, personal, or third-party private information unless the user explicitly confirms they have the right to publish it. Do not add links, mentions, hashtags, or claims the user did not request.

MPP mode is read-only. Never attempt writes, account-backed actions, monitors, webhooks, DMs, profile changes, or uploads when only `tempoSigningKey` is configured. Treat the signing key as sensitive config and never print it.

## Configuration

Credentials are stored in Encre plugin config (not environment variables). Users configure them via `Encre config set` commands - see the README for setup instructions.

**IMPORTANT: Never log, echo, display, or include API keys or signing keys in tool output, chat responses, or error messages. Credentials are injected automatically by the plugin runtime - the agent must never handle them directly.**

### API key mode (account-backed X automation)

Requires an Xquik API key from [dashboard.xquik.com](https://dashboard.xquik.com/).

### MPP mode (no account, pay-per-use)

MPP (Machine Payments Protocol) is an optional mode for anonymous, pay-per-use access to 32 read-only X-API endpoints - no Xquik account or API key required. The `tempoSigningKey` is a 66-character hex key that signs on-chain micropayment proofs (via the `mppx` SDK) when the runtime receives an HTTP 402 challenge. The signing key stays in the plugin config and is used only to sign paymen
