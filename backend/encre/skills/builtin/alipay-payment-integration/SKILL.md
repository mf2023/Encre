## Alipay Payment Integration

All Alipay payment product documentation is available via online dynamic links. Before integrating, always read the corresponding product's online documentation to get the latest API parameters and code examples.

### Documentation Access

Access Alipay online documentation using curl:

```bash
# Example: Get face-to-face payment docs
curl -sL "https://ideservice.alipay.com/cms/site/0izcu3"
```

#### Recursive Access
Document pages contain links that need recursive access for complete content:

1. First access the main document URL
2. Parse links in the document (product introduction, integration preparation, API docs, etc.)
3. Recursively access these links for detailed content

```bash
# Example: Access face-to-face payment sub-links
curl -sL "https://ideservice.alipay.com/cms/site/0izal0"   # Product introduction
curl -sL "https://ideservice.alipay.com/cms/site/0izal1"   # Integration preparation
```

### Integration Process

#### Step 1. Collect Integration Information
Before integrating, read the following based on user input:

- **SDK Selection**: Choose the General or Easy SDK based on your development language. Download link
- **Signing Method**: Supports RSA and RSA2; RSA2 (SHA256WithRSA) is recommended. Signing guide

#### Step 2. Get Product Integration Documentation
Get complete integration info based on the routed product: read the quick start guide, complete API documentation, async notification guide, notes, etc. Collect as much info as possible based on user input using curl.

Must read: Integration specifications and common pitfalls. Integration guide

Common error codes reference. Error code docs

#### Step 3. Integration Verification
Verify during integration and before going live: ensure signing/verification, async notifications, and exception handling comply with specifications. Verification results are for reference; always check the latest Alipay open platform documentation. See: Integration verification checklist

### Routing Table
Route to the corresponding product documentation based on the user's business scenario:

### Security Red Lines
The following are security red lines for Alipay payment integration. Violations may result in financial loss or security incidents. Must be strictly followed. Remind users to verify against the integration checklist and Alipay open platform documentation before going live.

- **Private key must NOT be stored on client**: Transaction data construction and signing must be done on the merchant server; private keys must NEVER be stored in the App client.
- **Private key must NOT be logged**: Private keys must NOT appear in any logs.
- **Private key must NOT be uploaded to public repositories**: Private keys must NOT be uploaded to GitHub, GitLab, or other public code repositories.
- **Front-end payment result is NOT trustworthy**: Synchronous redirect results from the front-end are not trustworthy. Always use Alipay async notifications or query API to confirm payment results.
- **Do NOT re-charge before confirmation**: Do not ask the user to pay again before confirming the payment result. Always confirm via async notification or query API first.
- **Async notification must be verified**: Always verify the signature of async notifications to ensure they come from Alipay.

### Environment
