"""Encre Sandbox Isolation System.

Three-layer sandbox architecture:

1. **Path isolation** (``_sandbox.py``)
   Remaps file paths into a per-session sandbox directory.
   Prevents path traversal attacks and symlink escapes.

2. **Container sandbox** (``container.py``)
   Docker-based isolation with seccomp, capability drop,
   read-only rootfs, and resource limits.  Supports both
   ephemeral (one-shot ``docker run --rm``) and persistent
   (session container) modes.

3. **Permission system** (``safety.py``)
   Static analysis + ML classification of commands before
   execution.  Routes dangerous commands through the
   container sandbox when enabled.

Usage::

    from encre.sandbox.types import SandboxConfig, SandboxMode, NetworkPolicy
    from encre.sandbox.container import EncreContainerSandbox

    # Ephemeral sandbox
    with EncreContainerSandbox("/path/to/workspace") as sb:
        result = sb.execute("ls -la")
        print(result.stdout)

    # With custom config
    config = SandboxConfig(
        mode=SandboxMode.CONTAINER,
        image="python:3.11-slim",
        timeout=60,
    )
    sb = EncreContainerSandbox("/path/to/workspace", config)
    sb.run_container()
    sb.exec_in_container("npm test")
    sb.stop_container()
