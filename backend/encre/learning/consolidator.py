"""Periodic memory consolidation for the learning subsystem.

The learning subsystem accumulates experiences in the agent's memory during a
run. Left unchecked, those short-term memories grow without bound and become
expensive to search. This module provides :class:`MemoryConsolidator`, a thin
background driver that periodically asks the agent's memory system to merge,
deduplicate, and summarise its stored memories (a process the code refers to as
"consolidation").

Design notes
------------
* The consolidator owns its own :mod:`asyncio` task and is fully decoupled
  from the agent loop: it never blocks normal execution because all work
  happens on a timer in a separate task.
* Consolidation is best-effort. If the agent has no ``memory_system``, or that
  object has no ``consolidate`` coroutine, the consolidator simply does nothing
  rather than raising. Failures during a consolidation pass are logged and
  swallowed so a misbehaving memory backend cannot crash the host loop.

Public surface
--------------
* ``start`` / ``stop`` -- begin and end the background timer.
* ``consolidate_now`` -- trigger a single pass on demand (useful for tests
  and for callers that want to flush memory at a checkpoint).

class MemoryConsolidator:
    """Drives periodic, best-effort memory consolidation on a background timer.

    The consolidator is a self-contained async driver. It holds a reference to
    the owning agent purely so it can reach that agent's ``memory_system``; it
    holds no other state. Lifecycle is explicit: call :meth:`start` to spin up
    the timer task and :meth:`stop` to cancel it cleanly.

    Attributes
    ----------
    _agent:
        The agent whose memory system will be consolidated. Accessed lazily via
        ``getattr`` so that an agent lacking a memory system is handled
        gracefully.
    _interval:
        Seconds to wait between consolidation passes. Defaults to 3600 (one
        hour).
    _running:
        Boolean flag gating the background loop. Flipped to ``False`` by
        :meth:`stop` to request a graceful exit.
    _task:
        The :class:`asyncio.Task` running :meth:`_loop`, or ``None`` when the
        consolidator is idle.

            interval: Seconds to sleep between automatic consolidation passes.
