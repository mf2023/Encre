"""Learning subsystem for Encre.

This package turns the agent's repeated behaviour into durable, reusable
knowledge so that future runs start from a richer baseline instead of raw
experience. It is composed of three collaborating components:

* :class:`~encre.learning.engine.LearningEngine` -- observes a running
  agent loop, records how tools are combined into patterns, and decides
  when a frequently repeated pattern is worth crystallising into a skill.
* :class:`~encre.learning.skill_generator.SkillGenerator` -- given a
  detected tool pattern, synthesises a structured skill definition (its
  trigger, the steps, and metadata) and registers it with the skill store.
* :class:`~encre.learning.consolidator.MemoryConsolidator` -- periodically
  drives the agent's memory system to merge, deduplicate, and summarise
  stored memories so that long-running sessions do not grow without bound.

The public surface of the package is intentionally small: only the three
classes above are re-exported through ``__all__``. Downstream code should
import them from this package rather than from their concrete modules.
