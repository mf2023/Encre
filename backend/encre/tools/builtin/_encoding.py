"""Encoding-neutral byte handling for subprocess / shell output.

Windows shells (cmd.exe / powershell) and locale-driven external programs
exchange text in the **system ANSI code page** — GBK (936) on zh-CN, Shift_JIS
(932) on ja-JP, EUC-KR (949) on ko-KR, cp1251 (1251) on ru-RU, … — *not* UTF-8.
Decoding such output as UTF-8 yields replacement characters the model cannot
use, and encoding commands as UTF-8 garbles non-ASCII input (often producing
no output at all).

Every tool that reads bytes from a subprocess should call :func:`decode_bytes`
instead of ``raw.decode("utf-8", errors="replace")``, and every tool that
writes text into a shell should use :func:`encode_text`.

Decode strategy (in order):
1. strict UTF-8 — the modern default (Linux/macOS, ``PYTHONUTF8``-aware tools,
   UTF-8 system locales);
2. the Windows ANSI code page via ``GetACP()`` — what the child actually wrote;
3. a small set of common legacy code pages as a safety net;
4. lossy UTF-8 so the caller always receives a string.
