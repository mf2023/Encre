# ``EncreMailbox`` is an asyncio-queue-backed inbox owned by one agent.  Agents
# ``send`` messages to another mailbox (delivering to its queue and archiving a
# copy) and ``receive`` (blocking with a timeout).  ``peek``/``clear`` support
# inspection and reset.  It is the lightweight channel used for consensus
# voting and teammate-to-teammate communication.
