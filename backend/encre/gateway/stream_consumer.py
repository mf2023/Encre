"""Gateway streaming consumer -- bridges agent events to platform delivery.

The agent runtime emits a stream of events (``TextDelta``, ``ToolResult``,
``Finish``) through ``EventRouter.submit_stream()``. ``GatewayStreamConsumer``
is the per-conversation object that turns that event stream into a smooth,
rate-limited delivery to a chat platform:

  1. ``feed()`` / ``feed_stream_event()`` receive events from the agent.
  2. Text deltas are buffered in memory as they arrive.
  3. Buffered text is pushed to the platform at a throttled cadence using
     progressive message editing, so the user sees the reply grow instead of
     appearing all at once.
  4. ``finalize()`` delivers the complete response (a final edit to strip the
     typing cursor, or a fresh send in buffer-only mode) and returns the full
     text.

        edit_interval: Minimum seconds between two consecutive progressive
            edits to the same preview message. Prevents flooding the platform
            with an edit on every keystroke.
        buffer_threshold: Minimum number of accumulated characters before an
            edit is pushed, unless a preview message already exists. Keeps very
            short replies from triggering chatty edits.
        cursor: A short marker (e.g. a typed-text glyph) appended to the
            preview text to signal "still streaming". Removed on finalize.
        buffer_only: When True, the consumer only buffers text and never

    finalizes the message and returns the complete text.

        ``_finish_error`` captures an agent error reported via a ``Finish``
        event so it can be surfaced to the user.
