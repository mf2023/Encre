"""Structured streaming events -- the agent-to-gateway delivery contract.

This module defines a typed event vocabulary that names *what happened* during
an agent turn without prescribing *how* it is delivered. The gateway's stream
consumer is the single sink for these events, while the platform adapter decides
how each event is rendered to the end user.

Design constraints:
    * Every event is a plain frozen (immutable) dataclass -- no behavior, no
      platform knowledge, and no I/O. This keeps construction cheap and makes
      the objects safe to pass across thread/async boundaries into the consumer
      queue.
    * Events are intentionally decoupled from the lower-level ``AgentEvent``
      union emitted by the runtime; the gateway translates between the two.
