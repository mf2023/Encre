"""Unified per-run loop state for the agent main loop.

Centralises the ~30+ scalar member variables that ``EncreLoop`` currently
carries across ``__init__``, ``run()``, and ``_run_impl()`` into a single
dataclass.  This makes it possible to:

* Snapshot the full loop state for diagnostics / telemetry at any point.
* Reset cleanly between runs without risking leaked state.
* Observe the loop's execution path via the embedded ``TransitionHistory``.

Usage::

    from encre.loop_state.state import LoopState

    # At the top of `_run_impl()`:
    state = LoopState(turn_count=self.session.turn_count)

    # After each transition:
    state.transitions.record(TurnTransition.NEXT_TURN, turn=state.turn_count)

    # For diagnostics at any point:
    snapshot = state.snapshot()
"""

from typing import Any

from encre.loop_state.transition import TransitionHistory


@dataclass
class LoopState:
    """All mutable loop state for a single ``_run_impl()`` invocation.

    This dataclass is the **single source of truth** for per-run counters,
    tracking variables, and transition history that were previously spread
    across ``EncreLoop.__init__`` member variables.  The ``EncreLoop`` still
    owns long-lived references (session, config, backends); this is purely
    the **ephemeral run state** that resets at the start of each user turn.

    Migration strategy (phased, no behavioral changes):

    Phase 1 — present: Own the transition history and provide ``snapshot()``.
           Inline counters (``_empty_response_retry_count`` etc.) remain on
           ``EncreLoop`` for now; this class shadows them for observability.

    Phase 2 — next: Move the per-run counters into this class and have
           ``_run_impl()`` reference ``self._state.empty_response_retry_count``
           instead of ``self._empty_response_retry_count``.

    Phase 3 — future: Merge with ``RecoveryStateMachine`` so the RSM consumes
           state from here rather than duplicating counters.
