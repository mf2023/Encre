class CacheContext:
    """Context for sharing prompt cache between parent and sub-agent.

    When a sub-agent is forked, the parent can pass its CacheContext so the
    sub-agent's system prompt begins with the *same prefix bytes* as the
    parent's cached context.  This allows Anthropic's prompt caching (and
    similar backend-level caching) to return a cache hit for the shared
    prefix instead of re-encoding it.

    The ``prefix_text`` is the exact text that appeared at the start of the
    parent's system prompt.  On API backends that support prompt caching
    (e.g. Anthropic with ``enable_prompt_caching=True``), the first N bytes
    are cached after the initial API call; sharing the same bytes on a
    sub-agent call means the cache is still warm.
