"""Device context provider framework.

A :class:`DeviceProvider` abstracts a single device-information source
(platform, hardware, GPU, display, network, location, sensor, battery).
Providers are pure read-only collectors that return a small JSON-safe
``dict`` describing one facet of the machine.  They run at agent startup
(or from cache) and their results feed the L1 catalog injected into the
system prompt, plus the L2 ``device_*`` tools that fetch details on demand.

Every provider must be defensive: catch its own exceptions and return
``None`` (or ``{}``) on failure so a missing platform API never breaks
agent startup.
