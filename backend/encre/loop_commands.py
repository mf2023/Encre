class CommandManager:
    """Manages the active slash command lifecycle.

    A slash *command* (built-in action or user-defined ``*.md`` command)
    is a sticky prompt injection that is NOT a mode: it does not intercept
    write tools and does not run the spec approval gate.  Once activated
    it stays in effect across turns (its ``command_instructions`` block is
    re-injected on every run) until explicitly cleared.  This mirrors the
    persistence model of :meth:`set_mode` so a command survives session
    reload / reconnect / restart: ``config.active_command`` is the
    in-memory mirror, ``StateManager.active_command`` is the
    on-disk source of truth.  A command and a mode (plan/spec) may be
    active at the same time -- they are independent slots.
