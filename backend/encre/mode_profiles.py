"""Per-mode capability profiles for the Encre agent.

Encre is one agent engine with deliberately distinct capability profiles:

* GENERAL mode  -- delivers artifacts, speed/performance balanced. The
  benchmark targets are general-purpose agents (Manus, ChatGPT).
* WORKSPACE mode -- a stricter profile layered on top of GENERAL that
  delivers production-grade artifacts, effect-first. The benchmark targets
  are vertical domain agents (OpenCode, Claude Code, Codex). It enables the
  planner/architect contract loop and hard verification gating.
* AUTOMATION mode -- directly reuses the GENERAL engine but runs headless
  (no user to answer verify nudges or approve plans). It disables the
  interactive gates and lowers parallel fan-out so background jobs are
  cheap and quiet.

Every mutually-exclusive tuning knob in the engine (auto-continue vs
verify gates, parallel fan-out vs stability, compaction vs delivery
evidence) is resolved to a concrete value per profile here, so the engine
logic reads one source of truth instead of scattered module constants.
