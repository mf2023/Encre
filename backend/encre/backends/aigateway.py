"""
AI Gateway backend -- generic API gateway with OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

AI Gateway provides a unified API gateway for accessing various LLM providers
through a single endpoint.  This backend is compatible with any gateway that
exposes an OpenAI-compatible chat completions API.

Base URL: Configurable via AI_GATEWAY_BASE_URL or explicit base_url.
Authentication: AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY environment variable or explicit api_key.
