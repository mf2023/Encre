"""
OpenRouter backend -- unified API for 200+ models across providers.

OpenRouter provides a single API endpoint that routes requests to 200+ models
from providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Mistral, and many  # noqa: E402
more.  It supports OpenAI-compatible chat completions with transparent cost
tracking and model fallback.

Base URL: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
Authentication: OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable or explicit api_key.

        Per OpenRouter docs the ``reasoning`` map may include
        ``enabled``, ``effort``, ``max_tokens``, and ``exclude``.

        For models routed via OpenRouter we send ``{"reasoning":
        {"enabled": True}}`` so that all underlying providers that
        support thinking (OpenAI o-series / GPT-5, Anthropic Claude,
        DeepSeek, GLM, etc.) will emit their reasoning tokens.  The
        response field is ``reasoning`` (single string) or
        ``reasoning_details`` (array of step objects); both are picked
        up by :data:`_REASONING_FIELD_NAMES` in
