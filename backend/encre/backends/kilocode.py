Kilo Code backend -- unified API gateway for multi-model access.

Kilo Code's AI Gateway provides a unified API endpoint that routes requests
to many models (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, etc.) through a single API key
and endpoint.

Base URL: https://api.kilo.ai/api/gateway
Authentication: KILOCODE_API_KEY environment variable or explicit api_key.
