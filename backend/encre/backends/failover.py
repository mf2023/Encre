"""
Failover backend -- chains multiple backends with automatic failover.

:class:`FailoverBackend` wraps an ordered list of :class:`BaseBackend`
instances and tries them in turn.  When the active backend raises an
exception or yields a :class:`BackendError` (including 529/overloaded), the
partial event stream is discarded and the next healthy backend is attempted.
Only a complete, successful stream is forwarded to the caller.

Per-backend health is tracked via :class:`BackendHealth`; backends that fail
consecutively are marked unhealthy and skipped for a recovery grace period.
Consecutive 529 errors are tracked separately and, once they reach
``RetryConfig.consecutive_529_threshold``, trigger the
``on_fallback_triggered`` callback.
