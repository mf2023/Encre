"""Git-style diffing helpers for the Encre agent.

This module wraps the operations the agent needs to describe and replay changes
to text files: computing a unified diff between two blobs, applying a diff back
onto text, parsing ``git diff --numstat`` output into aggregate counts, and
detecting in-progress (transient) git operations.

Implementation notes:
    * Diff computation and application are delegated to a Rust-backed native
      module (``encre.native``) for speed; this module is a thin, typed Python
      facade over those primitives plus pure-Python parsing/inspection helpers.
    * Nothing here shells out to the ``git`` CLI; numstat parsing and transient
      state detection are filesystem/string operations only.
