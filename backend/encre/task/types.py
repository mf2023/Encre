# Data model for the simple task layer.
#
# ``EncreTask`` is a serialisable record describing one unit of work: its
# identity, prompt, type, lifecycle ``status``, and the result/error produced
# once executed.  It is deliberately minimal so tasks can be created, updated,
# listed, and deleted through ``EncreTaskManager`` without external storage.
