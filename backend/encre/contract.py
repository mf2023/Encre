"""Architecture contract artifacts for production-grade delivery.

The workspace-mode flagship (architect / planner on top of general mode)
needs more than ephemeral advisor guidance: the design decisions a planner
or architect sub-agent produces must be persisted as a *living contract*
in the workspace and re-injected into the agent's context on every turn so
the coder stays anchored to the agreed architecture instead of drifting.

Files written by :func:`save_architecture_contract` live under
``<workspace>/.encre/contracts/`` and are loaded by
:func:`load_architecture_contract` into the system prompt each turn.
