"""Protocol dataclasses shared across the Encre LSP integration.

These lightweight ``dataclass`` types model the subset of the Language Server
Protocol we consume: positions, ranges, locations, diagnostics, hover results
and the overall connection state.  They are plain value objects with no
behaviour, so they can be built directly from decoded JSON payloads.
