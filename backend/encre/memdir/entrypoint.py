"""Load, store, and truncate the MEMORY.md entrypoint of a memory directory.

The entrypoint is the user-facing anchor of an agent's long-term memory.
This module transparently decrypts encrypted memory files, detects text
encodings (UTF-8/16/32 and BOM variants), and enforces configurable line
and byte size caps so the entrypoint can be injected into model prompts
without exceeding context limits.
