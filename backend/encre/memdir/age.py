"""Compute human-friendly ages and staleness hints for memory files.

This module converts filesystem modification timestamps (provided in
milliseconds since the epoch) into integer day counts, natural-language
age strings (e.g. "today", "3 weeks ago"), and a short reminder snippet
that warns the model when a memory may be stale. These helpers feed the
memory manifest and prompt construction in :mod:`encre.memdir.system`.
