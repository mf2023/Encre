"""Tests for plan / spec mode switching -- the single-source-of-truth model.

These tests lock down the invariants that previously broke mode switching:

* ``loop.plan_mode_active`` is *derived* from ``config.slash_command_mode``
  so the boolean flag and the mode string can never disagree.
* :meth:`EncreLoop.set_mode` is the only transition entry point and keeps
  ``config``, the ``session.metadata`` mirror, and the derived flag
  consistent.
* Exiting a mode clears the persisted metadata slot -- the old "sticky
  restore" bug where a one-off ``/plan`` kept replaying across every
  later normal message must not recur.
* ``spec`` mode does NOT activate write-tool interception (only ``plan``
  does); switching plan <-> spec flips the flag correctly.
