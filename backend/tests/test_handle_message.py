"""Tests for BaseAdapter.handle_message inbound routing (Phase 1).

Covers the canonical inbound entry: source normalization, the two-level
guard (queue while active, bypass for /stop etc.), dispatch to a registered
message handler or the legacy process_with_stream, and pending-message
drainage on completion.
