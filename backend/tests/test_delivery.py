"""Tests for gateway outbound delivery (Phase 2b).

Covers:
- :class:`DeliveryTarget.parse` for explicit and bare-adapter forms.
- :class:`DeliveryRouter.deliver` explicit-target / adapter-id / origin paths.
- Truncation: under-cap passes through; over-cap saves audit + appends note
  for non-chunking adapters; chunking adapters receive the full payload.
- Per-target failure isolation (one bad target does not abort the rest).
