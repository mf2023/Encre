"""Tests for the relay connector subsystem (Phase 4).

Covers:
- :class:`CapabilityDescriptor` serialization / unknown-key forward-compat.
- HMAC auth: upgrade token round-trip, multi-secret rotation, replay window.
- :class:`WebSocketRelayTransport` frame encode/decode + requestId RPC +
  4401 revocation handling (via a fake transport, no real WS).
- :class:`RelayAdapter` send / get_chat_info / inbound bridging (via a fake
  transport).
- Config-driven activation: ``relay_is_configured`` is False without a URL.
