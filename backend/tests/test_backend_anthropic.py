    This test class exercises ``aclose()`` across 2 scenarios covering normal
    client closure and idempotent double-close. The design ensures that the
    async cleanup path closes the underlying httpx client and never raises
    on repeated calls, preventing unhandled exceptions during server shutdown.

        ``aclose()``, then asserts ``is_closed`` is ``True`` because the
        HTTP client must be properly released back to the event loop on
        backend shutdown to avoid connection leaks.
